# TwitterBachelor

My Bachelor's Thesis (german), working with Twitter's published data sets on election interference. Here: The first published data set on russian activity between 2009 and 2018.
Using the Machine Learning technique of Natural Language Processing in R, I trained a model with 90 topics to identify main topics and phrases that the included russian accounts used to spread talking points, push stories and further their assigned goals

Most of this project was done in a private repository because of exam regulations, but now that I have handed my thesis in and gotten my evaluation, I might as well change it to public.
(Also this is the first time I used github/ tried being organized, so evrything might be a bit rough)
